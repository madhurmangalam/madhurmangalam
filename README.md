- 👋 Hi, I’m @madhurmangalam
- 👀 I’m interested in using Turing's cascade instability to knit together the mind, brain, and behavior.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning mathematical models that can generate multiplicative cascade dynamics to mimic physiological processes.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on experimental psychology and neuroscience studies.
- 📫 You can reach me at mangalam.madhur@gmail.com or (706) 804-1678.
